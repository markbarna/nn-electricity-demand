# Using Recurrent Neural Networks to Predict Electricity Demand
This is the documentation and code to support my capstone project for my M.S. in Data Science from George Washington University.

## Overview
Recurrent neural networks, especially those using the long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture, have been used effectively to analyze time series data. Unlike feedforward neural networks (FFNs), which seek to map inputs to outputs irrespective of sample order, LSTMs can learn patterns in a sequence of data. I wanted to test the efficacy of LSTM networks in predicting electricity demand in Texas. Specifically, I compared the prediction error of a LSTM network against an FFN with a sigmoid transfer function.
